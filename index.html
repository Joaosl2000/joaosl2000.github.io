<h1 class="title" align="center"> Bolsonaro</h1>



<p>The candidate I am advertising for is Bolsonaro. He is the Brazilian president who will run for re-election soon. My bot creates controversy by interpreting the comment and disagreeing with the author. Meaning: if the comment complements Bolsonaro the bot will reply criticizing and so on. For this reason, my bot does not support nor criticize the candidate Bolsonaro.
<br>
<p>My Task should be:
<br>
<p>80 pts for completing all tasks<br>
<p>10 pts for doing the website<br>
<p>5 pts for having my bot upvote any comment and/or submission mentioning my political candidate on the subreddit r/Bolsonaro (since nobosy chose the same candidate)<br>
<p>5 pts for writting more than 200 comments<br>
<p>10pts for posting more than 20 new submissions to the /r/csci040 subreddit<br>
<p>25 pts for anayzing and responding to comments differently based on their content<br>
<p>5 pts for using json libraries for my madlib<br>
<p>Hence, I belive my score should be 140/100<br>
<p> I did not create an army of 10 bots<br>

<p>Hence, I belive my score should be 140/100<br>
