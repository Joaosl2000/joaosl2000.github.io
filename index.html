<p>The candidate I am advertising for is Bolsonaro. He is the Brazilian president who will run for re-election soon. My bot creates controversy by interpreting the comment and disagreeing with the author. Meaning: if the comment complements Bolsonaro the bot will reply criticizing and so on. For this reason, my bot does not support nor criticize the candidate Bolsonaro.

My Task should be:

80 pts for completing all tasks
5 pts for having my bot upvote any comment and/or submission mentioning my political candidate on the subreddit r/Bolsonaro (since nobosy chose the same candidate)
5 pts for writting more than 200 comments
10pts for posting new submissions to the /r/csci040 subreddit

Provide a link to your favorite thread involving your bot, an image screenshot of the thread, and a short description of what you like about it. (Below each comment is a button labeled permalink that lets you link to a comment.)
Explain what you believe your score should be (clearly state which tasks you complete/don't complete).
25 pts for anayzing and responding to comments differently
5 pts for using json libraries for my madlib

Hence, I belive my score should be
