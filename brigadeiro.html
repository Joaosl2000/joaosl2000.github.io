<li>
<p> In a small sauce pan mix the sweet condensed milk, the cocoa powder, the salt and the butter.
</li>

<li>
<p> Bring the sauce pan to the stove and heat it over medium-low heat.
</li>

<li>
<p> Cook it, mixing constantly (this is important, otherwise it will burn!) until it thickens. A way to know is to run your wooden spoon (or spatula) in the middle of the mixture. If it takes a while for the mixture to move, then your brigadeiro is ready!
</li>

<li>
<p> Reserve, letting it cool to room temperature.
</li>

<li>
<p> In a plate or bowl, spread your sprinkles.
</li>

<li>
<p> Once the brigadeiro is cool, grease your hands with butter and roll the brigadeiros into little balls.(In Brazil we usually use half a tablespoon as measurement, but you can make your balls as big or small as you'd like!)
